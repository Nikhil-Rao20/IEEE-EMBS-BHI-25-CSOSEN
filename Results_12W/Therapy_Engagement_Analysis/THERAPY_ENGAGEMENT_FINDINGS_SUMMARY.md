## Part 1: Therapy Engagement by Medical Condition

### üî¥ **CANCER (n=108, 64.7% of patients)**

#### Therapy Engagement Levels:
- **Mindfulness sessions started:** 36.89 ¬± 35.56 (vs. 16.27 non-cancer, **p < 0.001**)
- **Sessions completed:** 32.09 ¬± 32.92 (vs. 13.68 non-cancer, **p < 0.001**)
- **Completion rate:** 77.2% ¬± 24.9% (vs. 49.9% non-cancer, **p < 0.001**)
- **Engagement score:** 1.50 ¬± 0.69 (vs. 0.88 non-cancer, **p < 0.001**)

**Cohen's d effect sizes:** Large effects (0.63-0.88), indicating cancer patients engage **SIGNIFICANTLY MORE** in therapy

#### Impact on Depression Outcomes:

**12-Week BDI Correlations:**
- Therapy completion rate: r = -0.172 (p = 0.075, trending)
- Therapy engagement: r = -0.133 (p = 0.170, not significant)

**24-Week BDI Correlations:**
- Therapy completion rate: r = -0.208 (**p = 0.030**, significant)
- Therapy engagement: r = -0.232 (**p = 0.016**, significant)

**High vs Low Engagement Outcomes (median split at 85% completion rate):**
- **12W:** High engagement: 6.74 ¬± 6.02 vs Low: 10.28 ¬± 8.75 (**p = 0.030**, -3.54 points)
- **24W:** High engagement: 5.80 ¬± 5.55 vs Low: 9.98 ¬± 9.44 (**p = 0.014**, -4.19 points)

**INTERPRETATION:** Cancer patients engage most actively in therapy, and **high engagement leads to significantly better depression outcomes**, especially at 24W. The protective effect strengthens over time.

---

### üíô **ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (n=39, 23.4% of patients)**

#### Therapy Engagement Levels:
- **Mindfulness sessions started:** 16.26 ¬± 22.76 (vs. 33.67 non-ACS, **p < 0.001**)
- **Sessions completed:** 13.85 ¬± 21.19 (vs. 29.16 non-ACS, **p < 0.001**)
- **Completion rate:** 49.1% ¬± 40.4% (vs. 73.2% non-ACS, **p = 0.004**)
- **Engagement score:** 0.82 ¬± 0.91 (vs. 1.42 non-ACS, **p < 0.001**)

**Cohen's d effect sizes:** Moderate to large effects (-0.51 to -0.76), indicating ACS patients engage **SIGNIFICANTLY LESS** in therapy

#### Impact on Depression Outcomes:

**12-Week BDI Correlations:**
- All correlations weak and non-significant (r = -0.11 to -0.18)

**24-Week BDI Correlations (UNEXPECTED POSITIVE CORRELATIONS):**
- Therapy completion rate: r = +0.276 (p = 0.089, trending)
- Therapy engagement: r = +0.159 (p = 0.332, not significant)
- **Spearman correlations stronger:** Completion rate œÅ = +0.374 (**p = 0.019**, significant)

**High vs Low Engagement Outcomes (median split at 50% completion rate):**
- **12W:** No significant difference (p = 0.734)
- **24W:** High engagement: 6.30 ¬± 4.95 vs Low: 3.47 ¬± 5.81 (**p = 0.013**, +2.83 points, PARADOXICAL)

**INTERPRETATION:** ACS patients show **LOWEST therapy engagement**. Surprisingly, at 24W, **higher engagement correlates with WORSE outcomes** (+0.374, p=0.019). This paradoxical finding suggests:
1. Patients struggling more may increase therapy participation
2. Cardiac rehabilitation may be more impactful than mindfulness
3. Selection bias: sicker patients engage more but still have worse outcomes

### üíö **RENAL INSUFFICIENCY (n=10, 6.0% of patients)**

#### Therapy Engagement Levels:
- **Mindfulness sessions started:** 19.90 ¬± 24.73 (vs. 30.22 non-renal, p = 0.378)
- **Sessions completed:** 15.90 ¬± 23.17 (vs. 26.20 non-renal, p = 0.289)
- **Completion rate:** 58.7% ¬± 36.4% (vs. 68.1% non-renal, p = 0.344)
- **Engagement score:** 1.10 ¬± 0.88 (vs. 1.29 non-renal, p = 0.457)

**Cohen's d effect sizes:** Small effects (-0.23 to -0.34), NO significant differences in therapy engagement

#### Impact on Depression Outcomes:

**12-Week BDI Correlations:**
- Weak and non-significant (r = -0.08 to +0.47)

**24-Week BDI Correlations (POSITIVE CORRELATIONS):**
- Therapy completion rate: r = +0.577 (p = 0.081, trending)
- **Therapy engagement:** r = +0.656 (**p = 0.039**, significant!)

**High vs Low Engagement Outcomes (median split at 60% completion rate):**
- **12W:** High: 6.00 ¬± 8.00 vs Low: 1.00 ¬± 2.24 (p = 0.180, +5.00 points trend)
- **24W:** High: 4.60 ¬± 2.51 vs Low: 1.20 ¬± 1.79 (p = 0.053, +3.40 points trending)

**INTERPRETATION:** Small sample (n=10) but shows **PARADOXICAL PATTERN** similar to ACS. Higher therapy engagement at 24W correlates with **worse depression** (r = +0.656, p = 0.039). However, renal patients already have **best baseline outcomes** (mean BDI = 3.5), so reverse causation likely: patients with persistent symptoms may increase therapy participation.

### üü° **LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION (n=10, 6.0% of patients)**

#### Therapy Engagement Levels:
- **Mindfulness sessions started:** 12.70 ¬± 22.32 (vs. 30.68 non-amputation, **p = 0.021**)
- **Sessions completed:** 10.80 ¬± 21.30 (vs. 26.53 non-amputation, **p = 0.020**)
- **Completion rate:** 43.8% ¬± 47.4% (vs. 69.1% non-amputation, p = 0.198)
- **Engagement score:** 0.90 ¬± 0.99 (vs. 1.31 non-amputation, p = 0.182)

**Cohen's d effect sizes:** Moderate to large effects (-0.49 to -0.76), indicating amputation patients engage **LESS** in therapy

#### Impact on Depression Outcomes:

**12-Week BDI Correlations:**
- Weak and non-significant (r = -0.07 to +0.35)

**24-Week BDI Correlations:**
- Weak and non-significant (r = -0.10 to +0.33)

**High vs Low Engagement Outcomes (median split at 31% completion rate):**
- **12W:** No significant difference (p = 0.833)
- **24W:** No significant difference (p = 0.674)

**INTERPRETATION:** Amputation patients show **low therapy engagement** but **NO clear correlation** between engagement and depression outcomes. Small sample size (n=10) limits statistical power. Physical rehabilitation and prosthetic adaptation may be more critical than mindfulness interventions.

#### **4. LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION (Low Engagement, No Clear Pattern)**
- **Evidence:** Low engagement, weak correlations, no significant impact
- **Clinical Action:**
  - üìç **Prioritize physical rehabilitation** and prosthetic adaptation
  - üìç **Screen for depression** but mindfulness may not be primary intervention
  - üìç **Small sample (n=10)** limits conclusions
  - üìç **Consider mobility-adapted interventions**

## Part 5: Limitations

1. **Small sample sizes** for Renal (n=10) and Amputation (n=10) conditions
2. **Observational design** limits causal inference (reverse causation possible)
3. **Paradoxical correlations** at 24W require further investigation
4. **Cancer dominance** (64.7% of sample) may influence overall patterns
5. **Missing data** in therapy metrics for some patients
6. **No adjustment** for baseline BDI or other confounders in correlations

---

## Part 6: Future Directions

1. **Causal mediation analysis** to disentangle therapy engagement ‚Üí depression vs depression ‚Üí therapy engagement
2. **Time-lagged correlations** to examine temporal patterns
3. **Stratified modeling** with baseline BDI adjustment
4. **Qualitative research** to understand engagement barriers in ACS/Amputation patients
5. **External validation** with independent cohorts
6. **Intervention trials** specifically targeting low-engagement conditions

---

## Conclusion

**Cancer patients benefit MOST from therapy engagement** with significant protective effects at 24 weeks (-0.232 correlation, p=0.016; high engagement reduces BDI by 4.19 points). This group should be **PRIORITIZED for mindfulness-based interventions**.

**Acute Coronary Syndrome patients show paradoxical patterns** where higher engagement correlates with WORSE outcomes at 24W, suggesting reverse causation or competing intervention effects from cardiac rehabilitation.

**Renal and Amputation patients** show mixed patterns with small sample sizes limiting conclusions. **Condition-specific intervention strategies** are warranted rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.

**Clinical recommendation:** Deploy **personalized, condition-stratified therapy protocols** with intensive mindfulness support for cancer patients and alternative/complementary approaches for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions.
