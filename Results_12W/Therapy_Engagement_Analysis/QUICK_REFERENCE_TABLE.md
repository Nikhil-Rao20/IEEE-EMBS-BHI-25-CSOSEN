# Quick Reference: Therapy Engagement by Medical Condition

## Key Statistics Table

| Medical Condition | N (%) | Sessions Completed | Completion Rate | 12W Correlation with BDI | 24W Correlation with BDI | High vs Low Engagement Effect (24W) |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Cancer** | 108 (64.7%) | 32.09 ± 32.92 | 77.2% ± 24.9% | r = -0.133 (p=0.170) | **r = -0.232 (p=0.016)** ⭐ | -4.19 points (p=0.014) ⭐ |
| **Acute Coronary Syndrome** | 39 (23.4%) | 13.85 ± 21.19 | 49.1% ± 40.4% | r = -0.114 (p=0.488) | r = +0.159 (p=0.332) ⚠️ | +2.83 points (p=0.013) ⚠️ |
| **Renal Insufficiency** | 10 (6.0%) | 15.90 ± 23.17 | 58.7% ± 36.4% | r = +0.466 (p=0.175) | **r = +0.656 (p=0.039)** ⚠️ | +3.40 points (p=0.053) |
| **Lower Limb Amputation** | 10 (6.0%) | 10.80 ± 21.30 | 43.8% ± 47.4% | r = +0.354 (p=0.315) | r = +0.333 (p=0.346) | +3.80 points (p=0.674) |

⭐ = Significant protective effect (higher engagement → lower depression)  
⚠️ = Paradoxical effect (higher engagement → higher depression, may indicate reverse causation)

## Clinical Interpretation Summary

### 🟢 **CANCER: MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM THERAPY**
- **Highest engagement** among all conditions
- **Strongest protective effect** at 24 weeks
- **Clinical action:** Prioritize therapy access, target >85% completion rate
- **Evidence:** High engagement reduces BDI by 4.19 points at 24W (p=0.014)

### 🔴 **ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: PARADOXICAL PATTERN**
- **Lowest engagement** among all conditions  
- **Paradoxical correlation** at 24W (higher engagement → worse outcomes)
- **Clinical action:** Investigate barriers, consider cardiac rehab as primary intervention
- **Evidence:** May reflect reverse causation (sicker patients engage more)

### 🟡 **RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: BEST BASELINE OUTCOMES**
- **Moderate engagement** (no significant difference from others)
- **Paradoxical correlation** at 24W (r = +0.656, p = 0.039)
- **Clinical action:** Maintain structured monitoring, reserve intensive therapy for high baseline BDI
- **Evidence:** Already excellent outcomes (mean BDI = 3.5), intensive monitoring protective

### 🟠 **LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION: NO CLEAR THERAPY BENEFIT**
- **Low engagement** (similar to ACS)
- **No significant correlations** with outcomes
- **Clinical action:** Prioritize physical rehabilitation over mindfulness
- **Evidence:** Small sample (n=10), physical adaptation may be more critical

## Engagement vs Non-Engagement Statistical Tests

### Cancer Patients vs Non-Cancer:
- Sessions completed: **+18.41** (p < 0.001), Cohen's d = **0.63** (moderate-large)
- Completion rate: **+27.4%** (p < 0.001), Cohen's d = **0.87** (large)
- Engagement score: **+0.62** (p < 0.001), Cohen's d = **0.80** (large)

### ACS Patients vs Non-ACS:
- Sessions completed: **-15.32** (p < 0.001), Cohen's d = **-0.51** (moderate)
- Completion rate: **-24.0%** (p = 0.004), Cohen's d = **-0.74** (moderate-large)
- Engagement score: **-0.60** (p < 0.001), Cohen's d = **-0.76** (moderate-large)

### Renal Patients vs Non-Renal:
- Sessions completed: -10.30 (p = 0.289), Cohen's d = -0.34 (small, NS)
- Completion rate: -9.1% (p = 0.344), Cohen's d = -0.28 (small, NS)
- **NO significant differences** in engagement

### Amputation Patients vs Non-Amputation:
- Sessions completed: **-15.73** (p = 0.020), Cohen's d = **-0.52** (moderate)
- Sessions started: **-17.98** (p = 0.021), Cohen's d = **-0.55** (moderate)
- Completion rate: -25.3% (p = 0.198), Cohen's d = -0.76 (large, trending)

## Correlation Strength Interpretation Guide

| Correlation (r) | Strength | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 0.00 - 0.10 | Negligible | No meaningful relationship |
| 0.10 - 0.30 | Weak | Small effect |
| 0.30 - 0.50 | Moderate | Medium effect |
| 0.50 - 0.70 | Strong | Large effect |
| 0.70 - 1.00 | Very Strong | Very large effect |

**Note:** Negative correlations with BDI are **PROTECTIVE** (higher engagement → lower depression)  
Positive correlations with BDI are **RISK FACTORS** (higher engagement → higher depression, likely reverse causation)

## Top Findings for Report Writing

1. **Cancer patients engage 2.3x MORE** in therapy than non-cancer patients (32 vs 14 sessions)
2. **Cancer high-engagement group shows 4.2-point LOWER BDI** at 24W compared to low-engagement (p=0.014)
3. **ACS patients engage 2.1x LESS** than non-ACS patients (14 vs 29 sessions)
4. **Renal patients show best baseline outcomes** (BDI=3.5) regardless of therapy engagement
5. **Therapy completion rate correlates -0.232** with 24W BDI in cancer patients (p=0.016)

## Recommended Analyses for Follow-Up

1. ✅ **Mediation analysis:** Does baseline BDI mediate therapy engagement → outcomes?
2. ✅ **Stratified models:** Build separate prediction models for each condition
3. ✅ **Time-series analysis:** Examine session-by-session depression trajectory
4. ✅ **Qualitative interviews:** Why do ACS/Amputation patients engage less?
5. ✅ **Dose-response curves:** Optimal therapy "dose" for each condition
