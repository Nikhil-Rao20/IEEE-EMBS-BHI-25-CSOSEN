# Initial Key Sights

Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis
This document summarizes the primary findings from the initial exploratory data analysis of the mental health dataset. Each insight is supported by statistical evidence and visualizations from the analysis report.

1. Overall Intervention Effectiveness: The intervention is successful in reducing depression scores.
The data shows a clear and positive impact of the mindfulness intervention, as patients' BDI-II scores decreased significantly on average after participating in the program.

Evidence: The mean BDI-II score dropped from a baseline of 11.17 to 7.48 after 12 weeks. This represents an average reduction of 3.57 points.

2. Temporal Impact: The positive effects are sustained and even slightly increase in the long term.
The benefits of the intervention do not fade over time. The average improvement in depression scores is not only maintained but appears to strengthen between the 12-week and 24-week follow-ups.

Evidence: The mean improvement in BDI-II score (Baseline - Follow-up) increased from 3.57 at 12 weeks to 4.27 at 24 weeks. This indicates a lasting and potentially growing positive effect of the therapy.

3. Disease-Specific Variability: Treatment effectiveness is highly dependent on the patient's medical condition.
This is one of the most significant findings. The mindfulness intervention has a dramatically different impact across various disease groups, suggesting that condition_type is a critical predictive factor.

Evidence: At 12 weeks, Dialysis patients showed an average BDI-II score improvement of 10.0, which is exceptionally high. In contrast, patients with conditions like "No prosthesis" (0.90 improvement) or "Prostate" (1.83 improvement) saw minimal benefits on average.

4. Demographic Impact (Sex): Female patients showed a greater average improvement than male patients.
There is a discernible difference in how male and female patients responded to the therapy, with females showing a more significant reduction in depression scores.

Evidence: The mean 12-week improvement for female patients was 4.69, nearly double the 2.68 mean improvement observed in male patients. The box plot in the report visually confirms this difference in distributions.

5. Weak Factors: Session volume and age do not show a strong direct correlation with improvement.
Surprisingly, two factors that one might assume are important—the number of sessions completed and the patient's age—have a very weak linear relationship with the reduction in depression scores.

Evidence (Sessions): The correlation between mindfulness_therapies_completed and 12-week improvement is extremely low at 0.0898.

Evidence (Age): The correlation between age and 12-week improvement is negligible at 0.0131.

6. Patient Engagement Profiles: Therapy completion is not uniform.
Patient engagement appears to follow a bimodal distribution. There isn't a simple bell curve of completion; rather, patients tend to either complete most of their sessions or very few.

Evidence: The histogram for completion_rate shows two peaks: a large one near 1.0 (high completion) and a smaller, but significant, one near 0.0 (low completion).

7. Data Quality Concern: There is a significant amount of missing outcome data.
A critical technical finding is the high rate of missing data for the primary outcome variables. This must be addressed carefully in the next phase of the project.

Evidence: There are 43 missing values (20.5%) for the bdi_ii_after_intervention_12w score and 44 missing values (21.0%) for the bdi_ii_follow_up_24w score.

# BDI vs Therapies Completed

Major Insights:
1. Best Treatment Outcomes:
12-week: Severe depression patients with medium completion (50-80%) → 20.0 point improvement
24-week: Severe depression patients with high completion (80-100%) → 22.8 point improvement
2. Completion Rate Impact by Severity Level:
Minimal Depression (0-13):

Low completion: ~2.4 points improvement
High completion: ~1.7 points improvement
Surprising finding: Higher completion doesn't always mean better outcomes for minimal depression
Mild Depression (14-19):

Low completion: ~4.5 points improvement
High completion: ~5.9 points improvement
Clear benefit: +1.4 points (12w), +1.6 points (24w) with higher completion
Moderate Depression (20-28):

Shows dramatic improvement with higher completion
High completion: ~11.4 points (12w), ~14.8 points (24w)
Severe Depression (29+):

Excellent response across all completion levels
High completion: ~13.7 points (12w), ~22.8 points (24w)
Best overall outcomes in this group
3. Success Rate Patterns (≥3 point improvement):
5 combinations achieve ≥70% success rate at 12 weeks
4 combinations maintain ≥70% success rate at 24 weeks
Severe depression patients show 100% success rate with high completion
4. Percentage Improvements:
Severe patients: Up to 61% improvement from baseline
Moderate patients: Up to 67% improvement from baseline
Mild patients: Up to 49% improvement from baseline
Minimal patients: Up to 37% improvement from baseline

1. BEST OUTCOMES:
   12-week: Severe (29+) + Medium (50-80%) → 20.0 point improvement
   24-week: Severe (29+) + High (80-100%) → 22.8 point improvement

2. COMPLETION RATE IMPACT BY SEVERITY:
   Minimal (0-13): High vs Low completion → +-0.7 points (12w), +-0.4 points (24w)
   Mild (14-19): High vs Low completion → +1.4 points (12w), +1.6 points (24w)
   Moderate (20-28): High vs Low completion → +nan points (12w), +nan points (24w)

3. SUCCESS RATE PATTERNS:
   Combinations with ≥70% success rate (12w): 5
   Combinations with ≥70% success rate (24w): 4
