# Corrected Feature Engineering Results

## Dataset Overview
- **Created**: 2025-10-01 00:29:24
- **Samples**: 167
- **Features**: 24
- **Targets**: 2

## Key Improvements Over Previous Version
✅ **ALL 4 real medical conditions**: Cancer, Acute coronary syndrome, Renal insufficiency, Lower-limb amputation  
✅ **Complete condition type encoding**: All 7 condition subtypes properly one-hot encoded  
✅ **No missing medical conditions**: Previous version was missing Cancer (64.7% of patients!)  
✅ **Proper disease burden calculation**: Based on all real medical conditions  

## Real Medical Conditions (4 total)
- Cancer: 108 patients (64.7%)
- Acute Coronary Syndrome: 39 patients (23.4%)
- Renal Insufficiency: 10 patients (6.0%)
- Lower Limb Amputation: 10 patients (6.0%)

## Condition Subtypes (7 total)
- Breast: 67 patients (40.1%)
- Prostate: 41 patients (24.6%)
- Revascularization: 31 patients (18.6%)
- No Prosthesis: 10 patients (6.0%)
- Predialysis: 9 patients (5.4%)
- Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: 8 patients (4.8%)
- Dialysis: 1 patients (0.6%)

## Data Quality
- Missing values: 0
- Infinite values: 0
- All expected conditions present: Yes
- Quality score: 100/100

## Critical Fix
This version fixes the major issue where **Cancer** (affecting 64.7% of patients) was completely missing from the binary condition columns in previous feature engineering attempts.
