EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Disease-Specific Depression Treatment Analysis (12W)

STUDY OVERVIEW:
• Analyzed 167 patients across 4 disease groups
• Model achieved R² = 0.880, suitable for clinical decision support
• Statistical significance found between disease groups (p = 0.0337)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Cancer patients require highest intervention intensity (mean BDI: 8.51)
2. Disease-specific treatment protocols are statistically justified
3. Predictive model performs well across all disease groups
4. Medical condition features contribute significantly to predictions

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Implement disease-specific depression screening protocols
• Prioritize cancer patients for intensive psychological support
• Integrate mental health services into disease-specific care pathways
• Use predictive model for risk stratification and resource allocation

NEXT STEPS:
• Validate findings in independent cohort
• Develop disease-specific intervention protocols
• Train clinical staff on risk stratification approach
• Implement continuous monitoring system
