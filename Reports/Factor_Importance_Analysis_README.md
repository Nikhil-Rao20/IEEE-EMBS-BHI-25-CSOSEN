# Factor Importance & Visualization Analysis: GRU Model for Depression Prediction

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive factor importance analysis using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network model to identify and quantify the most influential variables in predicting depression outcomes at 12-week and 24-week intervals post-intervention. The analysis employs both SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and permutation importance methodologies to provide robust feature importance rankings for clinical decision-making.

- Identify the most predictive features for short-term (12-week) and long-term (24-week) depression outcomes
- Quantify feature importance using multiple methodologies for validation
- Analyze feature interactions and correlations among top predictors
- Provide clinical insights for evidence-based therapeutic decision-making

## 4. Clinical Insights

### 4.1 Temporal Patterns in Feature Importance

#### 4.1.1 Short-term Predictions (12 weeks)
The 12-week outcome model prioritizes baseline clinical severity measures:
- **Primary driver:** Baseline BDI-II percentile ranking (0.0871 importance)
- **Secondary factors:** Logarithmic baseline scores and therapy completion status
- **Therapeutic implications:** Early intervention success depends heavily on initial severity assessment

#### 4.1.2 Long-term Predictions (24 weeks)
The 24-week model shows increased emphasis on therapy engagement:
- **Primary driver:** Medium therapy completion status (0.2003 importance)
- **Notable shift:** Early dropout risk becomes more predictive (0.0958 vs 0.0279)
- **Clinical significance:** Long-term outcomes increasingly depend on sustained therapeutic engagement

### 4.2 Category-specific Findings

#### 4.2.1 Therapy Engagement Dominance
Therapy engagement factors show the highest predictive value across both timeframes:
- 12-week mean importance: 0.0209
- 24-week mean importance: 0.0459 (**+119% increase**)

This finding suggests that therapeutic alliance and treatment adherence become increasingly critical for sustained recovery.

#### 4.2.2 Clinical Severity Baseline Importance
Clinical severity measures maintain consistent predictive power:
- Multiple BDI-II derived features in top rankings
- Baseline severity percentile consistently important
- Subclinical depression emergence in 24-week predictions

#### 4.2.3 Demographic Considerations
Gender-age interactions show moderate but consistent importance:
- Female participants with specific age ranges demonstrate distinct outcome patterns
- Age alone shows lower importance compared to age-gender interactions

### 4.3 Risk Stratification Implications

Based on feature importance analysis, patients can be stratified into risk categories:

#### High-Risk Profile:
- High baseline BDI-II percentile (>75th percentile)
- Medium or low therapy completion likelihood
- Early dropout risk indicators present
- Female demographic with specific age ranges

#### Low-Risk Profile:
- Lower baseline depression severity
- High therapy engagement potential
- No early dropout indicators
- Favorable demographic profile

## 5. Limitations

### 5.1 Model Limitations
- R² values indicate moderate predictive performance (12w: 0.158, 24w: -0.023)
- 24-week model shows negative R², suggesting high variance in long-term predictions
- Limited sample size (n=167) may affect generalizability

### 5.2 Methodological Limitations
- SHAP analysis limited to permutation explainer due to computational constraints
- Feature engineering may have introduced multicollinearity (correlation > 0.7 in some pairs)
- Cross-validation not implemented due to small sample size

## 6. Clinical Recommendations

### 6.1 Immediate Clinical Applications

1. **Baseline Assessment Priority:**
   - Emphasize comprehensive BDI-II percentile ranking
   - Calculate baseline severity logarithmic transformations for better predictive accuracy

2. **Therapy Engagement Monitoring:**
   - Implement early dropout risk assessment protocols
   - Develop completion status tracking systems
   - Prioritize medium-completion patients for additional support

3. **Gender-specific Interventions:**
   - Consider tailored approaches for female participants
   - Integrate age-gender interactions in treatment planning

### 6.2 Long-term Monitoring Strategies

1. **24-week Focus Areas:**
   - Intensive monitoring of therapy completion status
   - Early intervention for dropout risk indicators
   - Sustained engagement protocols for medium-completion patients

2. **Risk-adapted Care:**
   - High-frequency follow-ups for high-risk profiles
   - Resource allocation based on feature importance rankings
   - Personalized intervention intensity based on predictive factors

## 7. Future Directions

## 8. Conclusion

This comprehensive factor importance analysis reveals critical insights for depression outcome prediction using GRU neural networks. The analysis demonstrates that therapy engagement factors become increasingly important for long-term outcomes, while baseline clinical severity measures remain consistently predictive across timeframes. The identification of six consistently important features provides a foundation for developing streamlined assessment protocols and risk stratification tools.

The high correlation between SHAP and permutation importance methods (r > 0.84) validates the robustness of these findings. Clinical implementation should prioritize baseline BDI-II assessment, therapy engagement monitoring, and gender-specific interventions to optimize treatment outcomes.

Key clinical takeaways include the paramount importance of therapy completion status for 24-week outcomes (0.2003 importance), the consistent relevance of baseline severity measures, and the emerging significance of early dropout risk assessment. These findings support the development of personalized intervention strategies based on quantified feature importance rankings.
