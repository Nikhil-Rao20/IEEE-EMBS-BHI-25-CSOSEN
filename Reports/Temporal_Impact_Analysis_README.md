# Temporal Impact Analysis: Short-term vs Long-term Depression Outcomes

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive temporal impact analysis comparing short-term (12-week) and long-term (24-week) depression outcomes using GRU neural networks. The analysis examines temporal patterns in feature importance, recovery trajectories, and predictive performance to understand how factors influencing depression outcomes evolve over time. Key findings reveal significant temporal shifts in feature importance, particularly highlighting the increasing relevance of therapy engagement factors for long-term outcomes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Understanding temporal dynamics in depression treatment outcomes is crucial for developing effective intervention strategies. While short-term improvements may be driven by different factors compared to sustained long-term recovery, comprehensive analysis of these temporal patterns has been limited. This study addresses this gap by examining how predictive factors evolve across 12-week and 24-week time horizons.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this temporal analysis are to:
- Compare feature importance patterns between 12-week and 24-week outcomes
- Identify temporal shifts in predictive factors
- Characterize distinct recovery trajectories and patterns
- Analyze therapy engagement evolution over time
- Provide time-specific clinical recommendations

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Temporal Modeling Framework

**GRU Architecture for Temporal Analysis:**
- Sequential model with temporal reshape layers
- Dual training approach: separate models for 12w and 24w outcomes
- Temporal feature importance computed using SHAP permutation explainer
- Recovery pattern classification based on response trajectories

### 2.2 Temporal Definitions

**Response Criteria:**
- **Clinical Response:** ≥50% improvement in BDI-II scores

3. **Recovery Heterogeneity:** Four distinct recovery patterns identified, with 43.1% showing non-response
4. **Feature Evolution:** 9 features gain importance over time, while 19 lose importance

### 9.2 Clinical Implementation Strategy

**Short-term Focus (12 weeks):**
- Baseline severity assessment and demographic risk stratification
- Early therapy engagement optimization
- Initial response pattern monitoring

**Long-term Focus (24 weeks):**
